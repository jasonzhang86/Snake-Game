Developer Journal:

1. The snake starts to move really fast after frequently switching between game levels. In such cases, please press p to pause and press p again to resume as this resets the snake's speed to normal.

2. The countdown timer is shared by all three levels; switching between levels does not reset the timer. Level 3 also has a timer display but user may continue to play after timer reaches 0.

3. If the user is in level 3 and timer is currently 0, switching to other levels will reset the timer to 30.

4. Pressing R reset the game to the splash screen; however, sometimes the splash screen will turn into score screen after a few seconds. In such cases, please press R in the score screen to successfully reset the game.
